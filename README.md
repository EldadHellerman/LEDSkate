# ⛸️ LEDSkate ⛸️
This is a project of wifi controlled addressable LEDs, using esp8266, as well as an android app to control them.
The esp8266 also runs a low level interperter, so custom animations scripts can be written and executed.
The LEDs were mounted at the bottom of a pair of ice skates, each leg with it's own controller and battery.

The problem is that this project is so old that android studio just won't build the app.
I'll revisit this and publish something working when possible.
